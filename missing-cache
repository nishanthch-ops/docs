cache_control (boolean)

What it means: If enabled, the plugin respects upstream Cache-Control headers to determine cacheability and TTL.

Why empty? In your setup itâ€™s not enabled, because caching is being centrally controlled through explicit TTL (cache_ttl=300).

When to use: Enable only if you want Kong to defer caching decisions to backend APIs.

content_type (string/array)

What it means: Restricts cacheable responses by MIME type (e.g., application/json, text/html).

Why empty? Default behavior is to cache all supported types.

When to set: If you want to cache only certain responses, e.g., JSON APIs only.

cluster_addresses (array[string])

What it means: Redis Cluster node addresses.

Why empty? You are using a single-node Redis endpoint via AWS ElastiCache (not cluster mode).

When to set: If your Redis is deployed in cluster mode with multiple shards.

cluster_max_redirections (integer)

What it means: How many times to retry when redirected by a Redis Cluster node.

Configured as: 5

Why this value? Provides safe retry limit for cluster topology changes.

When to adjust: Increase only if your Redis cluster frequently rebalances.

cluster_nodes (array[string])

What it means: List of explicit Redis cluster nodes.

Why empty? Single endpoint (host) is being used with AWS ElastiCache.

connection_is_proxied (boolean)

What it means: Indicates whether the connection to Redis is proxied.

Configured as: false

Why? Direct connection to AWS Redis is used (not via a proxy layer).

keepalive_backlog (integer)

What it means: Number of queued connections waiting for a free keepalive slot.

Configured as: 0

Why? This disables backlog queuing. With pool size 256, requests are expected to fit without backlog.

password (string)

What it means: Redis authentication password.

Why empty? AWS ElastiCache Redis in your setup does not require AUTH (IAM-based or VPC-based security).

When to use: If Redis AUTH is enabled.

read_timeout / send_timeout (ms)

What they mean:

read_timeout: How long to wait for Redis to respond.

send_timeout: How long to wait when sending requests to Redis.

Configured as: 2000 ms each.

Why? Safe balance between responsiveness and stability.

sentinel_addresses (array[string])

What it means: List of Redis Sentinel addresses for HA failover.

Why empty? AWS ElastiCache does not use Sentinel; failover is handled automatically.

When to use: If running Redis with Sentinel for HA management.

sentinel_master (string)

What it means: Name of the Redis master monitored by Sentinel.

Why empty? Not applicable (AWS ElastiCache manages failover).

sentinel_nodes (array)

What it means: Explicit Sentinel nodes for monitoring.

Why empty? Not applicable in your setup.

sentinel_password / sentinel_username

What they mean: Authentication for Sentinel.

Why empty? AWS ElastiCache does not use Sentinel auth.

sentinel_role (string)

What it means: Determines whether to connect to Redis master or replica.

Why empty? Not applicable with AWS-managed endpoint.

server_name (string)

What it means: SNI (Server Name Indication) sent during SSL handshake.

Configured as: master.kong-redis.t1sxxx.use1.cache.amazonaws.com

Why? Required when using TLS with AWS ElastiCache, which expects the endpoint hostname.

username (string)

What it means: Redis username (if using ACLs).

Why empty? Not required for AWS ElastiCache unless ACLs are explicitly configured.

storage_ttl (integer, seconds)

What it means: Maximum lifetime of a cached item, regardless of cache_ttl or Cache-Control.

Why empty? Defaults to using cache_ttl (300 seconds).

When to set: If you want a hard limit on how long any cached item can persist.
